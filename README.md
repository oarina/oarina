# Hi there, I'm Arina 👋  

I’m fascinated by intricate systems and how technology and creativity intersect.  
Originally trained in animation and production, I pivoted into tech operations (incident response, support analysis) and have since explored full-stack development, crypto trading, and AI tooling.

## 🚀 About Me

I thrive where creativity meets complex systems. After graduating with honours in **traditional animation** (plus a year in 3-D) from the National Film School of Ireland, I pivoted into tech operations—triaging incidents at **a crypto exchange** and supporting enterprise clients for a **global social-media platform** (via a partner). Along the way I’ve built simple internal tools (e.g. a 300-term glossary that cut on-call lookup from 15 min to 3 seconds and written the odd script—such as a small Python back-tester that hit the Alpaca API—but my core value lies in keeping products reliable and users informed.

**What drives me**  
- Breaking down how products work and spotting weak points  
- Designing clear, low-friction processes that make teams faster  
- Translating technical detail for any audience  

*Based in Letterkenny, Ireland, and happy to relocate to Dublin for the right opportunity.*

## 🌟 Professional Background
Five years in tech ops, focused on incident response, executive support, and process design. At a **crypto exchange**,  I helped scale CX incident workflows from zero—eventually supporting over 700 incidents across outages, feature failures, and blockchain-related disruptions. At a **global social media** (via a partner), I resolved high-priority ad issues for VIP clients. More recently, I’ve handled VR bug triage, built internal tools, and launched documentation systems that made response time faster and teams more coordinated.
