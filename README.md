# Hi there, I'm Arina 👋  

I’m fascinated by intricate systems and how technology and creativity intersect.  
Originally trained in animation and production, I pivoted into tech operations (incident response, support analysis) and have since explored full-stack development, crypto trading, and AI tooling.

## 🚀 About Me

I thrive where creativity meets complex systems. After graduating with honours in **traditional animation** (plus a year in 3-D) from the National Film School of Ireland, I pivoted into tech operations—triaging hundreds of incidents at **a major crypto exchange** and supporting enterprise clients for a **global social-media platform** (via a consulting partner). Along the way I’ve built simple internal tools (e.g. a 300-term glossary that cut on-call lookup from 15 min to 3 s) and written the odd script—such as a small Python back-tester that hit the Alpaca API—but my core value lies in keeping large-scale products reliable and users informed.

**What drives me**  
- Breaking down how products work and spotting weak points  
- Designing clear, low-friction processes that make teams faster  
- Translating technical detail for any audience  

*Based in Letterkenny, Ireland, and happy to relocate to Dublin for the right opportunity.*
